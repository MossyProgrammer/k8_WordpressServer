## AKS - Kubernetes Wordpress Server
### Project Overview:
A Kubernetes cluster running a content management site, with a web front-end (Wordpress) running on one of the containers and a SQL database/back-end running on another. To deploy, please reference deployment.md


### Data Flow Diagram:
### Architecture Diagram:
### Services Being Used:
Azure Kubernetes Service(AKS) - hypervisor and container instances
### Adherence to Azure's Well Architected Framework:
### Future Revisions:
- Add additional content to the webpage itself, because it is currently very bare bones. Not that I know what to put on it, but that's beside the point.
- Deploy a website of my own onto the service rather than go through Wordpress.
